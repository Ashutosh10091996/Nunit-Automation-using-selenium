Project Description

This repository contains a test automation framework built using Selenium WebDriver, C#, and NUnit, designed to support reliable, maintainable, and scalable automated testing for web applications. The project demonstrates best practices in UI test automation and serves as both a practical testing solution and a learning reference for automation engineers working within the .NET ecosystem.

The framework leverages Selenium WebDriver to interact with web browsers and simulate real user behavior, enabling end-to-end validation of critical application workflows. C# is used as the core programming language, providing strong typing, object-oriented design, and seamless integration with modern .NET tools. NUnit is employed as the test runner, offering structured test execution, assertions, test grouping, and detailed reporting.

This project is structured to promote readability, reusability, and ease of maintenance. Common automation patterns such as the Page Object Model (POM) are used to separate test logic from UI locators, reducing duplication and making tests more resilient to UI changes. Configuration management allows tests to run across different environments and browsers with minimal setup changes.

Key features of the framework include:

Modular and scalable test architecture

Clear separation of test logic and page interactions

Reusable utilities for browser setup, waits, and assertions

Support for cross-browser testing

NUnit annotations for organized and flexible test execution

The repository is suitable for:

Automation testers building or improving Selenium frameworks

Developers interested in automated UI testing with C#

Students and beginners learning Selenium and NUnit

Teams looking for a baseline .NET test automation structure

Overall, this project aims to showcase a clean, extensible Selenium automation framework using industry-standard tools and patterns. It can be easily extended with additional test cases, reporting tools, CI/CD integration, or parallel execution, making it a solid foundation for real-world test automation projects.

If you want, I can:

Rewrite this in a beginner-friendly or enterprise tone

Customize it for a course project or real application

Add a matching README structure (Setup, Run Tests, Project Structure)
